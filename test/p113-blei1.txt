Abstract
A family of probabilistic time series models is
developed to analyze the time evolution of topics
in large document collections. The approach is
to use state space models on the natural parameters of the multinomial distributions that represent the topics. Variational approximations based
on Kalman filters and nonparametric wavelet regression are developed to carry out approximate
posterior inference over the latent topics. In addition to giving quantitative, predictive models of a
sequential corpus, dynamic topic models provide
a qualitative window into the contents of a large
document collection. The models are demonstrated by analyzing the OCR’ed archives of the
journal Science from 1880 through 2000.

1. Introduction
Managing the explosion of electronic document archives
requires new tools for automatically organizing, searching,
indexing, and browsing large collections. Recent research
in machine learning and statistics has developed new techniques for finding patterns of words in document collections using hierarchical probabilistic models (Blei et al.,
2003; McCallum et al., 2004; Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004; Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004; Buntine and Jakulin, 2004; Blei
and Lafferty, 2006). These models are called “topic models” because the discovered patterns often reflect the underlying topics which combined to form the documents. Such
hierarchical probabilistic models are easily generalized to
other kinds of data; for example, topic models have been
used to analyze images (Fei-Fei and Perona, 2005; Sivic
et al., 2005), biological data (Pritchard et al., 2000), and
survey data (Erosheva, 2002).

ment are assumed to be independently drawn from a mixture of multinomials. The mixing proportions are randomly
drawn for each document; the mixture components, or topics, are shared by all documents. Thus, each document
reflects the components with different proportions. These
models are a powerful method of dimensionality reduction
for large collections of unstructured documents. Moreover,
posterior inference at the document level is useful for information retrieval, classification, and topic-directed browsing.
Treating words exchangeably is a simplification that it is
consistent with the goal of identifying the semantic themes
within each document. For many collections of interest,
however, the implicit assumption of exchangeable documents is inappropriate. Document collections such as
scholarly journals, email, news articles, and search query
logs all reflect evolving content. For example, the Science
article “The Brain of Professor Laborde” may be on the
same scientific path as the article “Reshaping the Cortical Motor Map by Unmasking Latent Intracortical Connections,” but the study of neuroscience looked much different
in 1903 than it did in 1991. The themes in a document collection evolve over time, and it is of interest to explicitly
model the dynamics of the underlying topics.
In this paper, we develop a dynamic topic model which
captures the evolution of topics in a sequentially organized
corpus of documents. We demonstrate its applicability by
analyzing over 100 years of OCR’ed articles from the journal Science, which was founded in 1880 by Thomas Edison and has been published through the present. Under this
model, articles are grouped by year, and each year’s articles arise from a set of topics that have evolved from the
last year’s topics.
In the subsequent sections, we extend classical state space
models to specify a statistical model of topic evolution.
We then develop efficient approximate posterior inference
techniques for determining the evolving topics from a sequential collection of documents. Finally, we present qualitative results that demonstrate how dynamic topic models
allow the exploration of a large document collection in new

While traditional time series modeling has focused on continuous data, topic models are designed for categorical
data. Our approach is to use state space models on the natural parameter space of the underlying topic multinomials,
as well as on the natural parameters for the logistic normal distributions used for modeling the document-specific
topic proportions.

First, we review the underlying statistical assumptions of
a static topic model, such as latent Dirichlet allocation
(LDA) (Blei et al., 2003). Let β1:K be K topics, each of
which is a distribution over a fixed vocabulary. In a static
topic model, each document is assumed drawn from the
following generative process:
1. Choose topic proportions θ from a distribution over
the (K − 1)-simplex, such as a Dirichlet.
2. For each word:
(a) Choose a topic assignment Z ∼ Mult (θ).
(b) Choose a word W ∼ Mult (βz ).
This process implicitly assumes that the documents are
drawn exchangeably from the same set of topics. For many
collections, however, the order of the documents reflects
an evolving set of topics. In a dynamic topic model, we
suppose that the data is divided by time slice, for example
by year. We model the documents of each slice with a Kcomponent topic model, where the topics associated with
slice t evolve from the topics associated with slice t − 1.
For a K-component model with V terms, let βt,k denote
the V -vector of natural parameters for topic k in slice t.
The usual representation of a multinomial distribution is by
its mean parameterization. If we denote the mean parameter of a V -dimensional multinomial by π, the ith component of the natural parameter is given by the mapping
βi = log(πi /πV ). In typical language modeling applications, Dirichlet distributions are used to model uncertainty
about the distributions over words. However, the Dirichlet
is not amenable to sequential modeling. Instead, we chain
the natural parameters of each topic βt,k in a state space
model that evolves with Gaussian noise; the simplest version of such a model is

tion (Aitchison, 1982) to time-series simplex data (West
and Harrison, 1997).
In LDA, the document-specific topic proportions θ are
drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. In the dynamic topic
model, we use a logistic normal with mean α to express
uncertainty over proportions. The sequential structure between models is again captured with a simple dynamic
model
αt | αt−1 ∼ N (αt−1 , δ 2 I) .
(2)
For simplicity, we do not model the dynamics of topic correlation, as was done for static models by Blei and Lafferty
(2006).
By chaining together topics and topic proportion distributions, we have sequentially tied a collection of topic models. The generative process for slice t of a sequential corpus
is thus as follows:
1. Draw topics βt | βt−1 ∼ N (βt−1 , σ 2 I).
2. Draw αt | αt−1 ∼ N (αt−1 , δ 2 I).
3. For each document:
(a) Draw η ∼ N (αt , a2 I)
(b) For each word:
i. Draw Z ∼ Mult (π(η)).
ii. Draw Wt,d,n ∼ Mult (π(βt,z )).

Our approach is thus to model sequences of compositional
random variables by chaining Gaussian distributions in a
dynamic model and mapping the emitted values to the simplex. This is an extension of the logistic normal distribu-

The graphical model for this generative process is shown in
Figure 1. When the horizontal arrows are removed, breaking the time dynamics, the graphical model reduces to a set
of independent topic models. With time dynamics, the kth

For clarity of presentation, we now focus on a model with
K dynamic topics evolving as in (1), and where the topic
proportion model is fixed at a Dirichlet. The technical issues associated with modeling the topic proportions in a
time series as in (2) are essentially the same as those for
chaining the topics together.

3. Approximate Inference
Working with time series over the natural parameters enables the use of Gaussian models for the time dynamics;
however, due to the nonconjugacy of the Gaussian and
multinomial models, posterior inference is intractable. In
this section, we present a variational method for approximate posterior inference. We use variational methods as
deterministic alternatives to stochastic simulation, in order to handle the large data sets typical of text analysis.
While Gibbs sampling has been effectively used for static
topic models (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004), nonconjugacy
makes sampling methods more difficult for this dynamic
model.
The idea behind variational methods is to optimize the free
parameters of a distribution over the latent variables so that
the distribution is close in Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergence to the true posterior; this distribution can then be
used as a substitute for the true posterior. In the dynamic
topic model, the latent variables are the topics βt,k , mixture
proportions θt,d , and topic indicators zt,d,n . The variational
distribution reflects the group structure of the latent variables. There are variational parameters for each topic’s sequence of multinomial parameters, and variational parameters for each of the document-level latent variables. The
approximate variational posterior is

variables follows the same form as in Blei et al. (2003).
Each proportion vector θt,d is endowed with a free Dirichlet
parameter γt,d , each topic indicator zt,d,n is endowed with
a free multinomial parameter φt,d,n , and optimization proceeds by coordinate ascent. The updates for the documentlevel variational parameters have a closed form; we use
the conjugate gradient method to optimize the topic-level
variational observations. The resulting variational approximation for the natural topic parameters {βk,1 , . . . , βk,T }
incorporates the time dynamics; we describe one approximation based on a Kalman filter, and a second based on
wavelet regression.

In the commonly used mean-field approximation, each latent variable is considered independently of the others. In
the variational distribution of {βk,1 , . . . , βk,T }, however,
we retain the sequential structure of the topic by positing
a dynamic model with Gaussian “variational observations”
{βˆk,1 , . . . , βˆk,T }. These parameters are fit to minimize the
KL divergence between the resulting posterior, which is
Gaussian, and the true posterior, which is not Gaussian.
(A similar technique for Gaussian processes is described
in Snelson and Ghahramani, 2006.)

3.1. Variational Kalman Filtering
The view of the variational parameters as outputs is
based on the symmetry properties of the Gaussian density,
fµ,Σ (x) = fx,Σ (µ), which enables the use of the standard
forward-backward calculations for linear state space models. The graphical model and its variational approximation
are shown in Figure 2. Here the triangles denote variational parameters; they can be thought of as “hypothetical
outputs” of the Kalman filter, to facilitate calculation.
To explain the main idea behind this technique in a simpler setting, consider the model where unigram models βt
(in the natural parameterization) evolve over time. In this
model there are no topics and thus no mixing parameters.
The calculations are simpler versions of those we need for
the more general latent variable models, but exhibit the es-

algorithm estimates {βˆt }, which we view as observed data,
just as in the Kalman filter method, as well as the noise

For concreteness, we illustrate the technique using the Haar
wavelet basis; Daubechies wavelets are used in our actual
examples. The model is then

variational approximations (red and blue curves) smooth out the local fluctuations in the unigram counts (gray curves) of the words
shown, while preserving the sharp peaks that may indicate a significant change of content in the journal. The wavelet regression is able
to “superresolve” the double spikes in the occurrence of Einstein in the 1920s. (The spike in the occurrence of Darwin near 1910 may
be associated with the centennial of Darwin’s birth in 1809.)

local fluctuations in the unigram counts, while preserving
the sharp peaks that may indicate a significant change of
content in the journal. While the fit is similar to that obtained using standard wavelet regression to the (normalized) counts, the estimates are obtained by minimizing the
KL divergence as in standard variational approximations.
In the dynamic topic model of Section 2, the algorithms
are essentially the same as those described above. However, rather than fitting the observations from true observed counts, we fit them from expected counts under the
document-level variational distributions in (3).

4. Analysis of Science
We analyzed a subset of 30,000 articles from Science, 250
from each of the 120 years between 1881 and 1999. Our
data were collected by JSTOR (www.jstor.org), a notfor-profit organization that maintains an online scholarly
archive obtained by running an optical character recognition (OCR) engine over the original printed journals. JSTOR indexes the resulting text and provides online access
to the scanned images of the original content through keyword search.
Our corpus is made up of approximately 7.5 million words.
We pruned the vocabulary by stemming each term to its
root, removing function terms, and removing terms that occurred fewer than 25 times. The total vocabulary size is

15,955. To explore the corpus and its themes, we estimated
a 20-component dynamic topic model. Posterior inference
took approximately 4 hours on a 1.5GHZ PowerPC Macintosh laptop. Two of the resulting topics are illustrated in
Figure 4, showing the top several words from those topics
in each decade, according to the posterior mean number of
occurrences as estimated using the Kalman filter variational
approximation. Also shown are example articles which exhibit those topics through the decades. As illustrated, the
model captures different scientific themes, and can be used
to inspect trends of word usage within them.
To validate the dynamic topic model quantitatively, we consider the task of predicting the next year of Science given all
the articles from the previous years. We compare the predictive power of three 20-topic models: the dynamic topic
model estimated from all of the previous years, a static
topic model estimated from all of the previous years, and a
static topic model estimated from the single previous year.
All the models are estimated to the same convergence criterion. The topic model estimated from all the previous data
and dynamic topic model are initialized at the same point.
The dynamic topic model performs well; it always assigns
higher likelihood to the next year’s articles than the other
two models (Figure 5). It is interesting that the predictive
power of each of the models declines over the years. We
can tentatively attribute this to an increase in the rate of
specialization in scientific language.

Figure 4. Examples from the posterior analysis of a 20-topic dynamic model estimated from the Science corpus. For two topics, we
illustrate: (a) the top ten words from the inferred posterior distribution at ten year lags (b) the posterior estimate of the frequency as a
function of year of several words from the same two topics (c) example articles throughout the collection which exhibit these topics.
Note that the plots are scaled to give an idea of the shape of the trajectory of the words’ posterior probability (i.e., comparisons across
words are not meaningful).

5. Discussion
We have developed sequential topic models for discrete
data by using Gaussian time series on the natural parameters of the multinomial topics and logistic normal topic
proportion models. We derived variational inference algorithms that exploit existing techniques for sequential data;
we demonstrated a novel use of Kalman filters and wavelet
regression as variational approximations. Dynamic topic
models can give a more accurate predictive model, and also
offer new ways of browsing large, unstructured document
collections.
There are many ways that the work described here can be
extended. One direction is to use more sophisticated state
space models. We have demonstrated the use of a simple

Gaussian model, but it would be natural to include a drift
term in a more sophisticated autoregressive model to explicitly capture the rise and fall in popularity of a topic, or
in the use of specific terms. Another variant would allow
for heteroscedastic time series.
Perhaps the most promising extension to the methods presented here is to incorporate a model of how new topics in
the collection appear or disappear over time, rather than assuming a fixed number of topics. One possibility is to use a
simple Galton-Watson or birth-death process for the topic
population. While the analysis of birth-death or branching
processes often centers on extinction probabilities, here a
goal would be to find documents that may be responsible
for spawning new themes in a collection.

Figure 5. This figure illustrates the performance of using dynamic topic models and static topic models for prediction. For
each year between 1900 and 2000 (at 5 year increments), we estimated three models on the articles through that year. We then
computed the variational bound on the negative log likelihood of
next year’s articles under the resulting model (lower numbers are
better). DTM is the dynamic topic model; LDA-prev is a static
topic model estimated on just the previous year’s articles; LDAall is a static topic model estimated on all the previous articles.
